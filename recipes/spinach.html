        <p>Let's learn how to prepair it below:</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2 (16 ounce) bags fresh spinach</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch freshly grated nutmeg</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons minced shallot</li>
            <li>Â¾ cup heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon freshly grated lemon zest</li>
            <li> tablespoons finely shredded Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large soup pot over high heat; add spinach, cover, and cook for 1 minute. Uncover and gently stir until most of the leaves are bright green and wilted, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Quickly drain spinach in a strainer and transfer to a plate lined with 4 or 5 paper towels. Once cool enough to handle, squeeze as much liquid from the spinach as possible. Transfer spinach to a cutting board and coarsely chop.</li>
            <li>Mix cayenne pepper, nutmeg, salt, and black pepper in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat; stir in shallot and cook until just barely golden and translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in seasoning mixture and pour in cream; increase heat to medium-high and simmer until the cream sauce reduces by about half, about 5 minutes. Stir in lemon zest.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to low and toss spinach with cream sauce in skillet. Cook and stir until spinach is heated through and coated, about 2 minutes. Stir in Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese until thoroughly combined.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
